# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100% (Unless you count week 3's lecture videos)

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I don't really have a schedule. However, I usually watch them at home on Sundays. When I don't finish the lecture videos, I finish them either on Monday after work or I watch them late.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watching the lecture videos (mostly)

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

STOP PROCRASTINATING ON THE PRACTICALS (this is being written at 10:09 pm Sunday)!!! Try to watch all lecture videos before Monday. Remember that the online test is important and not an optional task (that was how the first one got submitted late).

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I already said that in the previous question.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

At least I'm getting them all done on time despite my extreme youtube and gaming addiction.
